#### __!! Spectrum.Plugins.ServerMod works for stable versions 5081 !!__  

Spectrum.Plugins.ServerMod is a plugin that adds some commands to the server, accessible by the host and players.  
All the commands are prefixed by '!'.  
If you are a client and you have the plugin, you can use some of your commands by replacing the '!' key to '%'.

Commands have 3 permission levels:
* __HOST__: Only the host can use the command
* __ALL__: All players can use the command
* __LOCAL__: Client-side command

Some commands with __ALL__ permission level can also be used as a client.  

__Playlist managing commands can't be used on trackmogrify mode (trackmogrify doesn't use playlists).__

# Command list (alphabetized):

#### Auto:
Permission: __HOST__  
Use: !auto  
Toggle the server auto mode.  
When auto mode is activated, the server will automatically jump to the next level when all players finish.  
If a level lasts longer than 15 minutes, the server continues to the next level.  
The maximum time on a level can be configured with the `autoMaxTime` settings.  
If the playlist ends, the server shuffles the playlist automatically.  
Auto mode doesn't work with Trackmogrify.  
At the end of a map, if votes are enabled, players can choose between the 3 next maps (or restart the current) on the playlist the one they wants to play next.  
If there are not enough players, the server will wait for players to join.  
The minimum players is configurable with the `autoMinPlayers` setting.


#### Autospec:
Permission: __LOCAL__  
Use: !autospec  
Toggles automatic spectating (useful when you go AFK or use auto mode).  
If the setting `autoSpecReturnToLobby` in the settings file is `true`: If you are the host and no players are online, the server will automatically return to the lobby.  
By default, `autoSpecReturnToLobby` is `false`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!play [filter]

If more than one level matches the name exactly, the first one is added.
