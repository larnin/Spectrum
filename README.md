### What is Spectrum?
Spectrum is a simple, yet powerful extension system for Refract Studios' game 
[Distance](http://survivethedistance.com/)
It allows you to write custom Lua scripts and DLL plugins to customize the
game's experience and make it do things the original game's developers didn't 
even think about. It's being constantly updated by one of the Distance community
members.
